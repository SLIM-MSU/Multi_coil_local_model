MRI local and global with model recon
=====================================

Code for testing and reproduicing results for MRI local study project:

Modl and blinps code according to the following paper

Anish Lahiri, Guanhua Wang, Sai Ravishankar, Jeffrey A. Fessler, (2021). "Blind
Primed Supervised (BLIPS) Learning for MR Image Reconstruction." IEEE
Transactions on Medical Imaging http://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3093770; [arXiv
preprint arXiv:2104.05028.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05028)

The code is made up of three components: \* single coil two channel study \*,\*
multi coil two channel study \*, and \*multi coil two channel model\*(with
PyTorch \> 1.7.0). \* Additionally, we used
[BART](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) to generate the dataset.

MRI local learning
------------------

make_two_channel_dataset specifies and show how to make the two channel dataset
based on the modification form https://github.com/JeffFessler/BLIPSrecon

Â 

two_channel_dataset_test specifies the data loader for MRI image loading from
multicoil MR measurements.

Unet mri local model can be used for local and global model training and testing
reconstruction from undersampled multi-coil k-space measurements using UNet
training.

`SOUPDIL.m` is the inner dictionary learning and sparse coding function that
takes overlapping patches in an initial image and learns a dictionary and a set
of sparse coefficients to represent these patches.

Deep Supervised Learning-based Image Reconstruction
---------------------------------------------------

The supervised learning approach used a training set generated from the [fastMRI
project](https://fastmri.org/). \* `Preprocessing.ipynb` provides an example of
the data-preprocessing. \* `MODL_DLMRI_Knee_vd.sh` gives an example of training
the neural network. \* The file `requirements.txt` denotes related Python
packages.
