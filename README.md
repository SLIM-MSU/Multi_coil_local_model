MRI local and global with model recon
=====================================

Code for testing and reproduicing results for MRI local study project:

Modl and blinps code according to the following paper

Anish Lahiri, Guanhua Wang, Sai Ravishankar, Jeffrey A. Fessler, (2021). "Blind
Primed Supervised (BLIPS) Learning for MR Image Reconstruction." IEEE
Transactions on Medical Imaging http://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3093770; [arXiv
preprint arXiv:2104.05028.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05028)

The code is made up of three components: \* single coil two channel study \*,\*
multi coil two channel study \*, and \*multi coil two channel model\*(with
PyTorch \> 1.7.0). \* Additionally, we used
[BART](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) to generate the dataset.

MRI local learning
------------------

make_two_channel_dataset specifies and show how to make the two channel dataset
based on the modification form https://github.com/JeffFessler/BLIPSrecon

Â 

global dataset  specifies the data loader for MRI image loading from
multicoil MR measurements for global case.

local network dataset and local netowrk dataset oracle specifies the data loader for MRI image loading from
multicoil MR measurements for noise local case and oracle local case.


train local unet  can be used for local  model training and testing
reconstruction from undersampled mulit-coil k-space measurements using UNet
training.

transfer learning local network  can be used for local  model training and testing
reconstruction from undersampled mulit-coil k-space measurements using DIDN
training.
